'''''Beautiful Garbage''''' (stylized as '''''beautifulgarbage''''') is the third studio album by American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]. It was released on October 1, 2001, on [[Mushroom Records]] worldwide, with the North American release on [[Interscope Records]] the following day. Marking a departure from the sound the band had established on their first two releases, the album was written and recorded over the course of a year, when lead singer [[Shirley Manson]] chronicled their efforts weekly online, becoming one of the first high-profile musicians to keep an Internet blog. The album expanded on the band's musical variety, with stronger melodies, more direct lyrics, and sounds mixing rock with [[electronica]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[girl group]]s.

Released three weeks after the [[September 11 attacks]], the album suffered from lack of promotion and the failure of its lead single "[[Androgyny (song)|Androgyny]]" to achieve high chart positions.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=[[Absolute Garbage|Thanks for Your Uhh, Support]] documentary |type=DVD |others=[[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] |publisher=[[Warner Bros.

A remastered and expanded edition of the album was released on November 5, 2021, to mark its 20th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/manson-garbage/|title=Garbage frontwoman hits out at the streaming giants making money at musicians' expense and why being on the road is costing the earth|author=English, Paul|work=[[The Sunday Post]]|date=October 18, 2021|access-date=November 2, 2021}}</ref> The triple CD set featured two bonus CDs, consisting of b-sides, alternate versions, previously unreleased recordings and remixes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/garbage-announce-20th-anniversary-reissue-of-beautiful-garbage-3021385|title=Garbage announce 20th anniversary reissue of 'Beautiful Garbage'|last=Skinner|first=Tom|work=[[NME]]|date=August 17, 2021|access-date=August 19, 2021}}</ref>
