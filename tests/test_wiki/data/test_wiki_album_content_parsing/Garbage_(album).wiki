'''''Garbage''''' is the debut studio album by American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]. It was released on August 15, 1995, by [[Almo Sounds]]. The album was met with critical acclaim upon its release, being viewed by some as an innovative recording for its time. It reached number 20 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number six on the [[UK Albums Chart]], while charting inside the top 20 and receiving [[Music recording sales certification|multi-platinum certifications]] in several territories. The album's success was helped by the band promoting it on a year-long tour, including playing on the European festival circuit and supporting the [[Smashing Pumpkins]] throughout 1996, as well as by a run of increasingly successful singles culminating with "[[Stupid Girl (Garbage song)|Stupid Girl]]", which received [[Grammy Award]] nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group]] in 1997.

In October 2015, the album was reissued to mark its 20th anniversary, featuring remastered tracks from the original analog tapes, as well as remixes and previously unreleased alternate versions of songs from the album.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Monroe |first1=Jazz |last2=Camp |first2=Zoe |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/59897-garbage-announce-debut-album-20th-anniversary-reissue-tour-playing-lp-in-full/ |title=Garbage Announce Debut Album 20th Anniversary Reissue, Tour Playing LP in Full |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=September 2, 2015 |access-date=December 28, 2015}}</ref>
